print("The itsy bitsy spider" , "climbed up" , "the waterspout.")


"""
    There is one print() function invocation, but it contains three arguments.
        All of them are strings.

    The arguments are separated by commas. We've surrounded them with spaces
        to make them more visible, but it's not really necessary, and we won't be
        doing it anymore.

    In this case, the commas separating the arguments play a completely different
        role than the comma inside the string. The former is a part of Python's
        syntax, while the latter is intended to be shown in the console.
