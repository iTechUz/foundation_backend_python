print("Hello, world!")


"""
    As you can see, this first program consists of the following parts:
    - the word print;
    - an opening parenthesis;
    - a quotation mark;
    - a line of text: Hello, World!;
    - another quotation mark;
    - a closing parenthesis.
    Each of the above plays a very important role in the code.
