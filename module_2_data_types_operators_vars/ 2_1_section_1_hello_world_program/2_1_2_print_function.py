print("Hello, World!")


"""
    The word print that you can see here is a function name.
    That doesn't mean that wherever the word appears it is always 
    a function name. The meaning of the word comes from the context
    in which the word has been used.
    
    You've probably encountered the term function many times before, 
    during math classes. You can probably also list several names of 
    mathematical functions, like sine or log.

    Python functions, however, are more flexible, and can contain
    more content than their mathematical siblings.
