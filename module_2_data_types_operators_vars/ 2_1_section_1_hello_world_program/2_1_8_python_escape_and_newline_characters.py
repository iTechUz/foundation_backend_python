"""
    The backslash (\) has a very special meaning when used inside strings
        ‒ this is called the escape character.

    The word escape should be understood specifically ‒ it means
        that the series of characters in the string escapes for the moment
        (a very short moment) to introduce a special inclusion.

    In other words, the backslash doesn't mean anything in itself,
        but is only a kind of announcement, that the next character after
        the backslash has a different meaning too.

    The letter n placed after the backslash comes from the word newline.

    Both the backslash and the n form a special symbol named a newline character,
        which urges the console to start a new output line.
